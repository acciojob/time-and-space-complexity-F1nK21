	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity in computer science describes how an algorithm's execution time grows as the size of the input data increases. As a programmer it should be our goal to make our website more efficient.</p>
	<p>The <b>Space Complexity</b> of an algorithm is the total space taken by the algorithm with respect to the input size. If you need to create an array of size n, this will take O(n) space.</p>
